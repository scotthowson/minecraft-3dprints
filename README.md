# Minecraft 3D Prints

Bring your Minecraft creations into the real world!

We turn your in-game builds into detailed 3D printed models, ready for display, gifting, or collection. Whether it's your kid's first house or a giant castle, we can make it real.

## How It Works

1. Submit your Minecraft world or schematic.
2. We process, optimize, and clean the model for printing.
3. You receive a high-quality physical model â€” printed and optionally painted.
